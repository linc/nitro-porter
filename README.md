## How to Contribute

### Data!

We greatly appreciate donated data from existing forums to improve the migration and its testing (using partial, anonymized records). A complete database dump is best way to do this. We protect privacy, but you're welcome to anonymize personally-identifiable information first. Willing to sign an extremely narrow NDA for the purpose if necessary. Contact lincoln@icrontic.com.
