## Reporting a Vulnerability

We greatly appreciate confidential security reports but cannot offer bug bounties at this time.

Contact security@lincolnwebs.com with "Nitro Porter Security" in the subject line.

Vulnerabilities will be evaluated with the CVSS 2.0 calculator within 30 days. 
Nitro Porter is not intended for ongoing deployment and vulnerabilities will be evaluated with that in mind.
